                    <p>
                      Born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, I attended the
                      University of Evansville in Southern Indiana to learn
                      programming including a semester spent abroad in the
                      United Kingdom, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in
                      Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I landed in
                      the Kansas City area shortly after graduating in the
                      summer of 2013.

                      Outside work, most of my attention goes towards watching
                      or playing Overwatch; playing, running, or watching
                      Dungeons &amp; Dragons; listening to the latest
                      progressive rock or power metal; being picky about food;
                      and spending time with my loving family: two aggressively
                      cute cats; a clumsy, joy-filled dog; and my wonderful
                      wife.

                      Since graduating from the University of Evansville in
                      2013, I've thrived in a handful of positions including
                      full LAMP stack work, a front-end specialty position (for
                      major brands like Gatorade and Frigidaire), and most
                      recently a UI-focused position with some C# when
                      necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I generally prefer working with JavaScript (ES6/7, React)
                      and CSS (Sass, or a CSS-in-JS solution); the visual and
                      interactive aspects of the web are where I'm most
                      comfortable and find the most enjoyment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I also prefer working in small teams. The best experience
                      I've had was with a single dedicated person covering each
                      part of a project, from design and user experience to
                      project management and development.

                      When I find a new programming technique I find
                      interesting, I do challenge myself to learn it, whether on
                      the job or at home. Some examples are rendering static
                      files from a React app, or React's recent Hooks feature. I
                      enjoy integrating my own interests as the content when
                      learning new technology. Recently I've conceptualized a
                      toolkit for Dungeons &amp; Dragons â€“ I like to call it
                      Papers &amp; Pencils.

                    <p>
                      The first piece of P&amp;P is a mobile-friendly dice
                      roller that can be found at{" "}
                      <Link to="/pnp/dice" target="_blank">
                        /pnp/dice
                      </Link>
                      . While there are plenty of dice rolling apps online, most
                      of them are full of text input fields that just feel
                      cumbersome on a touch screen. This project is currently
                      about 80% complete; the last major step is adding offline
                      functionality by converting it to a Progressive Web App.
                      Code-wise, this app is a React stateless component (with
                      TypeScript) using Hooks. Though a little complex, it's
                      very light-weight.

                    <p>
                      Future pieces include a notebook app with cloud database
                      functionality (like Firebase) and a procedural map
                      generator.

                      The code for the dice roller, this site, and now-outdated
                      work on the notebook (with Preact), can be found{" "}
